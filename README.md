# playTone-
This Arduino code provides an alternative to the built-in tone() function, as it allows for greater flexibility and customization in generating tones. By defining the frequency and duration of the tones and generating them using the playTone() function, users can create a wider variety of melodies and sound effects than with the standard tone() function. The loop() function plays two sets of notes in a descending and ascending order, with a brief delay between each set to showcase the playTone() function's capabilities. This code can serve as a valuable starting point for users who want to experiment with more complex and personalized melodies or sound effects.

More features will be added soon.
